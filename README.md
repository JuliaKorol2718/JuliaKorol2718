I'm a dedicated, interdisciplinary student, recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. My main areas of academic interests are data analysis and practical application of mathematics. 
I'm also interested in environmental studies, especially in the problem of climate change. 
I am currently looking for a challenging internship in Machine Learning and Data Science.
